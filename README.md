## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am Gayathri Netapalli from Kadapa, Andhra Pradesh, India.

I have completed my Bachelor's in 2024 from Kalsalingam University, Madhurai, Tamil Nadu.

I'm currently in USA for my Masters Degree in Applied computer Science at Northwest Missouri State University.

I like to draw a lot and I love to travel. And I like to play throwball as I can relieve my whole stress by throwing the ball.
